.SH SYNOPSIS
 $DATABASEDIR/.notmuch/hooks/*

.SH DESCRIPTION
Hooks are scripts (or arbitrary executables or symlinks to such) that notmuch
invokes before and after certain actions. These scripts reside in
the .notmuch/hooks directory within the database directory and must have
executable permissions.

The currently available hooks are described below.
.RS 4
.TP 4
.B pre\-new
This hook is invoked by the
.B new
command before scanning or importing new messages into the database. If this
hook exits with a non-zero status, notmuch will abort further processing of the
.B new
command.

Typically this hook is used for fetching or delivering new mail to be imported
into the database.
.RE
.RS 4
.TP 4
.B post\-new
This hook is invoked by the
.B new
command after new messages have been imported into the database and initial tags
have been applied. The hook will not be run if there have been any errors during
the scan or import.

Typically this hook is used to perform additional query\-based tagging on the
imported messages.
