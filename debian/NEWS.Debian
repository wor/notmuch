notmuch (0.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  There is an incompatible change in option syntax for dump and restore
  in this release. Please update your scripts.

  From upstream NEWS:

  The deprecated positional output file argument to notmuch dump has
  been replaced with an --output option. The input file positional
  argument for restore has been replaced with an --input option for
  consistency with dump.
